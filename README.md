A robust, command-line utility written in Python designed to generate highly secure and customizable random passwords. This tool ensures that passwords meet complexity requirements by guaranteeing the inclusion of selected character types.

## ✨ Features

* **Customizable Length:** Define the precise length (e.g., 12, 16, 20) of the required password.
* **Character Set Control:** Users can select which character sets to include:
    * **Letters:** Uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`).
    * **Numbers:** Numeric digits (`0-9`).
    * **Symbols:** Common punctuation and special characters.
* **Guaranteed Complexity:** The generator intelligently ensures that at least one character from every selected set is present in the final output, maximizing password strength.
* **Cryptographically Random:** Uses Python's built-in `random` module for generating secure, unpredictable outputs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

```bash
python --version
# Expected output: Python 3.x.x
InstallationClone the repository (or download the file):If you are using Git:Bashgit clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Password-Generator.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Password-Generator.git)
cd Password-Generator
If you are using the single file:Bash# Ensure PROJECT.py is saved as password_generator.py for clarity
No external dependencies: This project relies only on the standard Python library (random, string).UsageExecute the script directly from your terminal:Bashpython PROJECT.py
The program will prompt you for the following inputs:PromptInput TypeDescriptionEnter the desired password length:IntegerMust be a positive number.Include letters (y/n)?y or nIncludes A-Z, a-z.Include numbers (y/n)?y or nIncludes 0-9.Include symbols (y/n)?y or nIncludes !@#$%^&*(), etc.Example$ python PROJECT.py
